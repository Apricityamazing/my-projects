<a id="project" href="https://github.com/Apricityamazing/my-projects/tree/main/Responsive-Web-Design/survey-form">Survey Form</a>
<p>This was not my best work as you can see. Poorly formatted, and it doesn't even look good. I could definetly do better, and I think I did in my next projects. I also didn't do the project as you were actually supposed to and only filled out the requirements.</p>

<a id="project" href="https://github.com/Apricityamazing/my-projects/tree/main/Responsive-Web-Design/tribute-page"/>Tribute Page</a>
<p>I think I had significant growth making my tribute page. I not only tried a bit to make the project look good, it also has extra stuff that I didn't need to do. I know its not great, but I think it put me in a much better spot than my previous project</p>

<a id="project" href="https://github.com/Apricityamazing/my-projects/tree/main/Responsive-Web-Design/technical-documentation">Technical Documentation Page</a>
<p>(This page is to large to show as an image) I am proud of this project. While it is kinda facetious because I wasn't sure what to do for the documentation page, I think it still shows an immense growth.</p>

<a id="project" href="https://github.com/Apricityamazing/my-projects/tree/main/Responsive-Web-Design/product-landing-page">Product Landing Page</a>
<p>I don't think I put the most amount of effort I could put into this page, but I think it still turned out well. It kinda being a form shows how much I grew from my first project. I am proud of this project.</p>
